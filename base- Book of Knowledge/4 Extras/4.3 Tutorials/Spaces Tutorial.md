### **Areas**

**Definition**: Ongoing, long-term responsibilities or aspects of your life that need to be maintained over time.

**Think**: “Always active,” not “done when complete.”

**Examples of Areas:**

- **Health** → Includes exercise routines, sleep tracking, doctor visit notes.
    
- **Relationships** → Reflections on friendships, family, connection habits.
    
- **Finances** → Budget overview, saving strategies, recurring bills.
    
- **Career Development** → Goals for improvement, certifications, performance logs.
    
- **Personal Growth** → Journaling practices, skill learning paths (e.g., language learning).
    

> 🟨 **Use Areas to reflect maintenance**: If it’s a “hat you wear” or a “role you play,” it belongs here.

### **Projects**

**Definition**: Specific, outcome-oriented efforts with a clear end goal and due date (or at least a done state).

**Think**: “Has an end,” even if it’s far off.

**Examples of Projects:**

- **Redecorate Bedroom** → Tasks, budget, shopping list, mood board.
    
- **Plan 2025 Summer Vacation** → Itinerary, bookings, to-dos.
    
- **Write Short Story Collection** → Progress tracking, draft links, publishing goals.
    
- **Learn Python Basics** → Milestones, resources, completion checklist.
    

> 🟦 **Projects end, Areas don’t.** Once done, a project is archived. If it repeats often, consider turning it into an Area.

### **Support Notes**

**Definition**: Notes that support your Areas and Projects with research, reference material, or ideas.

**Think**: “Library” or “raw material.”

**Examples of Support Notes:**

- A **guide** on Pomodoro Technique (used in your Productivity Area or Study Project)
    
- A **list of gift ideas** (used in Relationships or Birthday Project)
    
- A **reference** on tax deductions (used in Finances Area or Tax Filing Project)
    
- A **recipe** you want to try (used in Health Area or Meal Planning Project)
    

> 🟩 **Support Notes don’t need structure or timeline.** They exist to feed other files.

If you're ever unsure where something belongs:

- **Does it need to be “completed”?** → Project.
    
- **Is it something you’re always working on?** → Area.
    
- **Is it a reference or resource?** → Support Note.
