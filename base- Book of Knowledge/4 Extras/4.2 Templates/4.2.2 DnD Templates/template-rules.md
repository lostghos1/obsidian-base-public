## **⚙️ Core Mechanics**

- **Dice System:** (E.g., "We use a d20 system for most checks.")  
- **Skill Checks:** (E.g., "Players roll a d20 and add their relevant modifier.")

## **⚔️ Combat Rules**
> *Rules specific to combat encounters.*  

- **Initiative:** (E.g., "Combat is resolved by rolling for initiative. Highest roll goes first.")  
- **Attack Rolls:** (E.g., "To attack, roll a d20 and add your attack bonus. If the result is equal to or higher than the target's AC, the attack hits.")  
- **Damage:** (E.g., "Weapons deal damage as per their type. Roll the corresponding dice to determine damage.")  
- **Movement:** (E.g., "Players can move up to their movement speed in combat.")  
- **Actions in Combat:** (E.g., "Players can take one action and one bonus action per turn. They can also move and interact with objects.")

## **🪄 Magic Rules**

- **Magic System:** (E.g., "We use a traditional Vancian magic system where spells are memorized and expended after casting.")  
- **Spellcasting Modifiers:** (E.g., "Spell attack rolls are based on your spellcasting modifier (usually Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).")  
- **Ritual Casting:** (E.g., "Certain spells can be cast as rituals, taking 10 extra minutes to cast but not expending a spell slot.")
