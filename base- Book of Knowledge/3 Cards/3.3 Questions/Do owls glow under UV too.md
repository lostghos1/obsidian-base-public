# Do owls glow under UV too??

---

## Simple Answer

Yes, **some owls also fluoresce under UV light**, particularly their **feathers**, which can glow a **faint pinkish or whitish** color.

---

## Details / Thoughts / Research

- The **fluorescence** is typically subtle and often shows up as **pale pink, lavender, or whitish** under UV.
    
- Found in species like:
    
    - **Barn owls**
        
    - **Eastern screech owls**
        
    - Possibly others — research is ongoing.
        
- The glowing effect is likely due to **porphyrins**, the same class of compounds responsible for flying squirrels’ pink glow.
    
- Interestingly, **porphyrins degrade in sunlight**, so UV fluorescence can actually help scientists **age owl feathers**: older feathers glow less brightly.
    
- The fluorescence is **not visible under normal light**, only under UV, and it’s more commonly seen in **newer feathers or juveniles**.
