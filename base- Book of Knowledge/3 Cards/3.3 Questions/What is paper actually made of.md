## Details / Thoughts / Research

- The main ingredient is **cellulose**, a natural polymer found in the **cell walls of plants**.
    
- Most modern paper is made from **softwood or hardwood trees**, like pine or birch.
    
- The process involves:
    
    1. **Pulping**: breaking down wood into a slurry of fibers.
        
        - Can be **mechanical**, **chemical**, or both.
            
    2. **Bleaching** (optional): makes paper whiter, especially for printing or writing.
        
    3. **Forming sheets**: drying the pulp and pressing it into thin layers.
        
- Specialty papers (like **cotton rag paper**) are made from textile fibers instead of wood, making them more durable.
    
- **Recycled paper** is made by reprocessing used paper back into pulp.
