# Does squirrels skull glow pink under UV??

---

## Simple Answer

**Flying squirrels** have **fur** that glows pink under UV light — **not their skulls**, and **not regular squirrels**.

---

## Details / Thoughts / Research

- The **pink fluorescence** was discovered in **2019** in North American flying squirrels.
    
- The glow is caused by **porphyrins** in the **fur**, which fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light.
    
- Hypotheses include:
    
    - **Communication** between squirrels
        
    - **Mimicry** of owls (some of which also fluoresce)
        
    - **Camouflage** in moonlight conditions
        
- **Regular squirrels** (like greys or reds) and **squirrel bones/skulls** do **not** fluoresce pink under UV light — bones usually show up as **bluish-white**, if at all.
